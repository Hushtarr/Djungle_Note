## What is a Class and an Object?

In Java, a **class** is a blueprint defining the structure and behavior of **objects**. 
**Object** is an instance of a **class**, created using the new keyword. 

## What is the behavior of an Object?

The **behavior** of an object is what it can do, represented by its **methods**. 

## What is object-oriented programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a coding approach(way) that uses objects, combining data and functions, to structure and organize code. 

## What is the key principles of Object-oriented programming?

The key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. 

## What is **Encapsulation**?

Encapsulation is the principle of Java to helps in creating a secure and organized way of managing and using objects in a program. It involves declaring variables as private to control access and using public methods to interact with the data. 

## What is **inheritance**?

Inheritance in Java allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. It establishes a "is-a" relationship, where a subclass inherits from a superclass for better organization.

## Why do we use **inheritance**?

We use inheritance in programming to achieve code reuse and create a hierarchy of classes. It allows promoting a modular code structure.

## What are **inheritance** Types?

1. Single Inheritance:
   A subclass can inherit from only one superclass.

2. Multiple Inheritance (through interfaces):
   A subclass can inherit from more than one interface, but not more than one class.

3. Multilevel Inheritance:
   A class can inherit from another class, and then another class can inherit from the second class, creating a chain.

4. Hierarchical Inheritance:
   Multiple classes inherit from a single superclass, forming a hierarchy.

5. Hybrid Inheritance (combination of the above):
   A mix of multiple inheritance types.

## What is Abstraction?

Abstraction in Java means simplifying complex things by focusing on what's essential and ignoring unnecessary details. 
It helps in hiding the implementation complexity and providing a clear interface for using the functionality. 
In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

## What's the use of 'super' and 'this' keyword?

super keyword: Refers to the immediate parent class. Used to call methods or constructors of the superclass.\
this keyword: Refers to the current instance of the class. Used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters.
(ps: In an interview setting, you can simply say that super is for the superclass, and this is for the current instance.)

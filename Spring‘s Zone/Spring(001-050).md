# Spring (Core)

## Can you give a big picture of the Spring?

What do you think about Spring?

• Spring came into being in 2003 as a response to the complexity of the early J2EE specifications.

• Spring started out as an Inversion of Control (IoC) container for Java. We still relate Spring mostly to it.

• We refer to Spring as a framework, but Spring is much more complex. Spring is not just a framework indicates the core functionalities.

• Spring is an ecosystem of frameworks and not just one framework. Spring makes programming Java
quicker, easier, and safer for everybody. Spring's focus on speed, simplicity, and productivity has
made it the world's most popular Java framework.

• Spring is called the framework of frameworks. The reason is that the frameworks are supported by
Spring such as Struts, Hibernate, JSF and likewise.

• Spring is a very powerful yet lightweight Java Enterprise Edition application development framework.

• Spring offers an entire ecosystem formed of many projects which we use in application development
such as Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, Spring Batch, Spring Boot.

Spring框架是2003年为了应对早期J2EE规范的复杂性而诞生的。起初，Spring被设计成一个用于Java的控制反转（IoC）容器。直到今天，我们仍然将Spring与其关联。尽管我们将Spring称为一个框架，但实际上它的复杂性远超这个范畴。Spring不仅仅是一个框架，这表明了其核心功能之外的多样性。

Spring实际上是一个框架生态系统，而不仅仅是一个框架。Spring使得编写Java代码变得更快、更简单、更安全，这使得它成为了世界上最受欢迎的Java框架。Spring被称为“框架的框架”，原因在于Spring支持许多其他框架，如Struts、Hibernate、JSF等。

Spring是一个功能强大且轻量级的Java企业级应用开发框架。

Spring提供了一个完整的生态系统，包含了许多我们在应用开发中使用的项目，例如Spring Data、Spring Security、Spring Cloud、Spring Batch、Spring Boot。这些特点使得Spring不仅仅局限于其核心功能，而是为开发者提供了一个全面的解决方案，让Java编程变得更加高效和简便。
